Concept: A smart contract system (or a Uniswap v4 Hook) that provides users with the absolute best execution for stablecoin swaps by dynamically routing through either a direct Aerodrome pool OR a multi-hop route via Uniswap (e.g., USDC -> WETH on Uniswap -> TargetStable on Uniswap) if that path, even with extra steps, surprisingly offers a better net rate after gas and fees. It would also feature a "stability vault" component that utilizes Aerodrome for yield.
Core Problem Solved:
Best Rate Execution for Stables: While Aerodrome is optimized for stable-to-stable, highly fragmented liquidity or unusual market conditions on Uniswap could occasionally offer a better arbitrage path for certain stablecoin pairs, especially less common ones. This engine finds it.
Capital Efficiency & Yield: Users parking stablecoins while waiting for optimal swap conditions can earn yield.
How it Works (MVP):
Dynamic Routing Logic (The "Uniswap DeFi" part):
A user wants to swap Stablecoin A for Stablecoin B.
The engine queries:
The direct rate on the relevant Aerodrome A/B pool.
Potential multi-hop rates on Uniswap (e.g., A -> ETH -> B on Uniswap v3/v4). This requires an on-chain price oracle or a simulation.
It calculates the net output after estimated gas and fees for both routes.
It executes the swap via the most optimal path.
Uniswap v4 Hook Implementation: This routing logic could be built as a Uniswap v4 hook. When a user tries to swap stables on a "hook-enabled" Uniswap pool, the hook checks if Aerodrome offers a better rate and routes there if it does, or executes on Uniswap if that's better. This is a powerful demonstration.
Stability Vault & Yield (The "Aerodrome Stablecoin" part):
Users can deposit stablecoins (e.g., USDC, DAI) into a "Stability Vault."
The vault automatically deploys these stablecoins into high-yield, low-risk Aerodrome stablecoin liquidity pools (e.g., USDC/DAI LP on Aerodrome, or whatever Aerodrome offers with good APR).
When a user initiates a swap from the vault's balance, the system withdraws the necessary stablecoins from the Aerodrome LP, performs the optimal swap (as per point 1), and sends the target stablecoin to the user.
This allows parked capital to earn yield while remaining readily available for optimized swaps.
Why it's Unique & a Winner:
Dual Sponsor Integration: Deeply uses Uniswap for its general-purpose AMM capabilities and potential v4 hooks, and Aerodrome for its specialized stablecoin AMM efficiency and yield opportunities.
Addresses a Real User Need: Users always want the best swap rates and to earn yield on idle capital.
Technically Interesting: The dynamic routing and v4 hook implementation are non-trivial.
Capital Efficiency: The vault ensures idle stables are working for the user.
Synergistic: Uniswap and Aerodrome aren't competing here; they are tools in a larger optimization engine.
Benefit for Uniswap:
Showcases a sophisticated use-case for v4 hooks (if implemented this way).
Drives volume to Uniswap pools when it's the optimal route.
Positions Uniswap as a foundational layer for more complex DeFi strategies.
Benefit for Aerodrome:
Drives significant and consistent TVL and volume to its stablecoin pools (both for direct swaps and for the Stability Vault).
Highlights Aerodrome as the preferred venue for stablecoin yield and primary stable-to-stable swaps on Base.
Key Features for MVP:
Smart contract for the Stability Vault (deposit/withdraw stablecoins).
Integration with 1-2 Aerodrome stablecoin LPs for yield.
Routing logic for one specific stablecoin pair (e.g., USDC to DAI):
Query Aerodrome direct rate.
Query Uniswap multi-hop rate (USDC->WETH->DAI).
Execute via the better path.
Simple UI for depositing into the vault and initiating a swap.
If going for the v4 hook, that would be the central piece of the Uniswap integration.
"Wow" Factor: An intelligent, self-optimizing stablecoin swap and yield generation engine that leverages the best of both Uniswap and Aerodrome on Base.
